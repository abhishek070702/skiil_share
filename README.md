PAF Project 01 (3 year 1 semester)




SkillShare is a web application designed to help people share their skills, learn new skills, and connect with others easily.
Users can create profiles, post about their skills, plan their learning goals, connect with other users, share posts, comment, like, and get notifications â€” all in one place!

The platform makes learning and skill-sharing interactive and social, making it easier for users to build communities, grow professionally, and achieve their personal development goals.
